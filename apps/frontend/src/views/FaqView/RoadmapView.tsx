Many of our voting systems are live and battle-tested today. But we are still refining several of them. We are also working on a few new voting systems that will be released in the coming weeks. Here is a list of voting systems that are currently in the works:
`;

const ROADMAP_DESCRIPTION_1_PART_2 = `
Multi-token voting, quadratic voting w/ sybil resistance, treasury management contracts, and more.
`;

const ROADMAP_DESCRIPTION_2_PART_1 = `
XBallot's on-chain forums are one of the most exciting features of the platform. We are currently working on a multi-threaded forum system that will allow for deep discussions and debates.`;

const ROADMAP_DESCRIPTION_2_PART_2 = `
We currently support a three-level system: Post level, thread level, and sub-thread level. We are working on a system that will allow for unlimited sub-threads.`;

const ROADMAP_DESCRIPTION_3_PART_1 = `
Integrating a domain registrar with a DAO management system is a complex task. We currently support minting, updating, and assigning domains anywhere within our protcol. We are working on a system that will allow for secondary sales of domains. `;

const ROADMAP_DESCRIPTION_3_PART_2 = `
Down the road we are planning to build a system that will allow DAOs to register their own domains and subdomains. This will allow DAOs to create their own decentralized websites`;

const ROADMAP_DESCRIPTION_4_PART_1 = `
Our objective is to build a platform that is fully decentralized and community-owned. The first step in this process is to open-source our tooling.`;

const ROADMAP_DESCRIPTION_4_PART_2 = `
We are currently working on a system that will allow anyone to build their own XBallot interface. We are also working on an API/SDK that will allow developers to build their own applications on top of the XBallot protocol.`;

        XBallot is currently in late-stage V1 development. There are many exciting features built to
        production today with a lot more on the way. Some features that are live now are not fully
        functional yet. This is intentional while we field test and recieve feedback. Here is a list
